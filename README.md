### How it Works:
You can earn a certificate from IBM Quantum while gaining skills in Quantum Computing using Qiskit.

We have Qiskit Coding Challenge Jupyter Notebooks and Hackathon Prompts for you to work on in-person, if you choose, and on your own remotely between Oct. 1 - Nov. 3, 2025.  You can work together in a group, or individually.    

### Criteria for Certificates:

| Certificate Type | Criteria for Awarding | 
| :---------------------- |:----------------------------|
| Participation Certificate | Submit a completed Qiskit Beginner or Intermediate Notebook by Nov. 3, 10am PT or attend at least one of the FF in-person meetings: 9/30, 10/4, 10/11, or any other one that might still be added. | 
| Winning Certificate       | Submit completed versions of the Qiskit Beginner and Intermediate Notebooks or Submit work on one of the Hackathon prompts or on a project of your own design by Nov. 3, 10am PT |

### How to Submit your work?

Submit your work by sending a direct message in Discord (nhawkins), Meetup (Natalie Hawkins), or LinkedIn (natalie-hawkins-seattle) or an email to nrhawkins@gmail.com with ONE of the following, as well as indicating your full name as you wish it to appear on the certificate:
- a link to a github repo or other storage location, like Box, containing your work
- attach your file(s) to the message
